# SOLID Principle in Golang
SOLID is an object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), have 5 principles :

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open / Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

## Why
To make project easier to maintain and extend as project grows, with avoiding bad code that have some indicators :
- Ridgility (Difficult to change, even small pieces)
- Fragility (Easily crashed when code being changed)
- Immobility (Not reusable)
- Complex (Over engineered)
