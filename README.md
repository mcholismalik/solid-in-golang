# SOLID Principle in Golang
SOLID is an object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), have 5 principles :

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open / Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

## Why
To make project easier to maintain and extend as project grows, with avoiding bad code that have some indicators :
1. Rigidity (Difficult to change, even small pieces)
  - Dont aware of improvement of some feature
2. Fragility (Easily crashed when code being changed)
  - Dont aware of unexpected condition
3. Immobility (Hard to refactor, not reusable)
  - Write a whole busines rules in one function
4. Viscosity (Like swim in syrup)
  - Bad written, pattern, or documentation.
